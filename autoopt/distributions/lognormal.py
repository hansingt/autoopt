"""
This module implements the logarithmic normal distributions for parameter decoration.

There are two different distributions implemented in this module:

    1. The logarithmic normal distribution (LogNormal)
    2. The quantized logarithmic normal distribution (QLogNormal)

from .normal import Normal, QNormal


class LogNormal(Normal):
    """
    Defines a parameter as being drawn from a logarithmic normal distribution.

    This distribution can be used if the values of a parameter should be sampled around
    the logarithm of a mean value (loc) with a specified standard deviation (scale).
    The `loc` and `scale` parameters do not define the mean and standard deviation of
    the logarithmic normal distribution, but instead of the underlying
    normal distribution. Thus, a random variable `X` is defined as being
    logarithmic normal distributed if a second variable `Y` exists with
    :math:`Y = normal(loc, scale)` such that :math:`X = e^Y`.

    For positive values, this distribution is unbound.
    Thus, theoretically all positive real values can be sampled, but the probability
    get's lower as the distance to the mean rises. For negative values, this
    distribution is undefined and thus, they can't be sampled.

    The probability density function (PDF) is defined as follows:

        P(X) = 1/sqrt(2*pi*scale^2)*e^(-(ln(X)-loc)^2/(2*scale^2)) if X > 0 else 0

        Calculate the probability for the given `x` to be sampled.

        :param x: The value to calculate the probability for.
        :return: The probability that the given value is sampled.

        return super().pdf(np.log(x)) / x if x > 0 else 0.0


class QLogNormal(QNormal, LogNormal):
    """
    The quantized normal distribution acts the same as the normal distribution,
    but the values, that get samples are quantized.
    Thus, it only samples values which are multiple of the given quantizer.

    The PDF of the QNormal distribution is defined as follows:

        P(X) = 1/sqrt(2*pi*scale^2)*e^(-(round(X/q)-loc)^2/(2*scale^2))
